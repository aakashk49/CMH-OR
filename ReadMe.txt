Chandy–Misra–Haas Algorithm for the OR model:

I. Compiling and Running:
	This solution was developed in Windows Operating System using MicroSoft Visual Studio Express 2013.
	If Visual Studio is installed, simply go to DC_Assignment Folder and open the solution file DC_Assignment.sln. This will open the Visual Studio.
	To Build go to BUILD menu > Build Solution Option.
	After Build Successful, To Run Press F5.
	If Visual Studio is not present, it can be compiled using any method.
	
							OR
							
	Executable File is already present along side this ReadMe file as DC_Assignment.exe.
	Simply Double click the exe to start the Program.
	
II. Input Format:
	1. When this program is Run, first it will ask for number of Processes/Nodes (n). Enter a positive numeric value and press Enter. Eg. 6
	2. Then Program will prompt for number of edges (m) present in the WFG. Enter the number of edges and press Enter. Eg. 8
	3. Then for each edge enter the source and destination nodes. This will be done m (no of Edges) times.
	   Eg for edge 1 --> 2  , enter input 1 2
	4. Then Program will ask for initiator Node S. Input Node number S such that 1 <= S <= n.
	5. Then a message will be printed whether deadlock has been detected or not.
	6. Press Enter to exit the program. Open the Program again to Run.
	
	Note:
	Two Sample Inputs SampleInput1.txt and SampleInput2.txt along with their diagrams has been placed alongside this ReadMe.
	Sample Inputs can be directly copied and pasted after running the program.
	
III. Source Code:
	 Source Code File CMH_OR.cpp has been placed along this ReadMe file.
